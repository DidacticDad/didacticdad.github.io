## Ad Victorem

full dark dawns

plump to spill

bloat and bloviating

cringing damp in pickup beds

tarps drawn down

shushing lips signal fires

tantalize ohsoclose

home, such a word!

last spoke God knows

when, could exist still True?

No. No is true. No absolute.

horrored cry animal now squelching blood

we all sleep weeping.

all to win.

at least

we won.

we won.
