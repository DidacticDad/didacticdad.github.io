## Spoila
<br>



perfectly pressed

white-grey woodblock

mulls smooth aloft

invisible tributaries

"They're just clouds."

borders crackling all blue

just electric against eternity

"But but but" calling

and fading fading

flaccid yellowed standard limps

off into the unknowable

building impossible habitats to house God

<br>

"That one looks like a dragon."

quiet and windkissed

lightly beaming

God and I giggle in the grass.
