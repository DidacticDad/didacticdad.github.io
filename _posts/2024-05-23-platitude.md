## Platitude

Solemnity turning burns eternal

Folding fades her summers vernal

<br>

It or wit, someone's journaled

over heart and over coats all worn

in weather tropic sweat beads slowly

creasing dresses greasy flustered flesh

all packed and fishy smiling lies

and smelling ebullient swelling eyes

<br>

She never tried to scream or struggles

sliding into subtle fondness

among the fronds in someone's

eternal

vernal

funeral.
