Some of us don't create anymore.

If everything has to be ironic to avoid being made the target of ridicule, 
and if the robots are going to overwhelm us anyway, 
and the dead internet howls around us,
then what good is this?

Nevertheless, I'd still like to sit, 
quiet, 
on a low hill beneath a tree, watching the moon fall around me.

And so I write.

A little, or a lot. All at once, or hardly ever at all.
Not enough to depend on.
Just enough to say there is some life left somewhere
someway.

Thank you for stopping by.
